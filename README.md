The Advantage Weighted Regression algorithm based on the research paper by Xue Bin Peng, Aviral Kumar, Grace Zhang &amp; Sergey Levine - "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00177.pdf". 
The following code demonstrates its use for three environments 
1. Open AI CartPole environment 
2. A custom Wumpus World environment (Based on the Wumpus World environment from the book "Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norving  
3. A modified multi-agent version of the Wumpus World environment.

This algorithm achieves better performance than traditional online DQN algorithms.
